# Performance Module

## 📌 Overview

This module covers the **Performance** aspects of the WebWork system.  
It ensures that the platform operates reliably and responsively under expected and peak loads.

---

## 🔍 What is tested

### Functional Scenarios:
- Page load times
- Dashboard responsiveness
- Report generation speed
- API response times

---

### Security and Access:
- Rate limiting on APIs
- Protection against DoS attacks
- Secure resource allocation

---

### Edge Cases:
- Large data sets (e.g., timesheets, reports)
- Multiple concurrent user sessions
- Sudden spikes in traffic
- Slow or unreliable network conditions

---

### UI/UX:
- Progress indicators during long operations
- User feedback for loading states
- Avoiding freezes or unresponsive UI
- Accessibility of performance-related messages

## 🧪 Priority

This module has **High Priority**.  
Performance is critical for **user satisfaction** and **system reliability**.

---

## 📎 Notes

- Validate performance under normal and peak conditions  
- Ensure no regressions in response times  
- Simulate realistic user behavior during tests  
- Use automated tools where possible (JMeter, LoadRunner, Postman)
