## 📌 Overview

This module covers everything related to the authentication functionality of the WebWork platform.  
The goal is to ensure that all access mechanisms are reliable, secure, and user-friendly.

- Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)

### Security Scenarios:
- Rate limiting and brute-force protection
- Login attempts with invalid tokens
- Access to protected routes without authentication
- Session hijacking prevention
- Token expiration and refresh logic

### Edge Cases:
- Inputs with SQL injections, XSS
- Login without email confirmation
- Passwords with special characters
- Simultaneous logins from multiple devices

### UI/UX:
- Feedback messages for failed logins
- Visibility toggle for password fields
- Consistent layout and responsiveness on all devices
