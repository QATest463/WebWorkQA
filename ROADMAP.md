A clear roadmap for documenting and automating QA for the WebWork platform.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Build structured QA documentation (manual + automated)
- ✅ Follow modular structure per feature
- ✅ Include both exploratory and formal testing

Each module includes:

- ✅ Manual Checklists (functional + non-functional)
- ✅ Bug Reports (categorized)
- ✅ API Test Cases & Postman collection
- ✅ Automation: Playwright (UI) + PyTest (API)
- ✅ Exploratory Sessions
- ✅ Backend/SQL checks (as needed)

Modules are added incrementally for maintainability and clarity.
